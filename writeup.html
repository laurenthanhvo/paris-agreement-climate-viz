  <h3>1. What have you done so far?</h3>
  <p>
    So far, we have gathered the full dataset and completed the cleaning process to remove missing values. 
    We also explored the data using summary statistics and visualizations to identify early patterns and potential relationships between variables. 
    Beyond that, we created our base map and early chart prototypes, which helped us confirm that our data formatting and scaling were correct. 
    Finally, we built a functional version of the interactive components, allowing the map and chart to update based on user-selected filters.

  <h3>2. What will be the most challenging part of your project to design, and why?</h3>
  <p>
    The most challenging part will be designing the final interactive map and ensuring that it responds smoothly to user input. 
    This is difficult because we need to balance detailed data presentation with performance, especially as updates occur every time the slider or filter changes. 
    We also need to make the visualization intuitive, so users immediately understand what each color, line, and value represents without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, 
    we want to make sure that we create a meaningful narrative that guides users through the data, which requires careful planning of the user experience and interface design.
